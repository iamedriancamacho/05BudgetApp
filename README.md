Hi!

Thank you for testing our software application on our Budget Application. This is in compliance to our Prelims Examination as well as a projects of our Mobile Development 2. 
Our team and I have been working hard in order to make this project perfect. However, it is not always the case. You may encouncer some bugs along your tests, but that is okay
since this isn't a final version of our application. All of your filed issues do contribute into making our project successful. 

With that said, Please do find time and look at anything that you feel is an error towards the software and my team and I will be here to fix all of your issues. 
We hope you have a wonderful day!


Regards,
Edrian, Project Development Head
